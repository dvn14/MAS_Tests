# MAS_Tests

Each file has the seperate parts for the Multi-Agent Systems Coursework.

### Part 1: AA

Almost done I think.
Successfully tested in/for:
 * Self attacks
 * Attacks against each other
 * Mentimeter Example
 * c(mary) example
 * AA tutorial example (not sure about the argument(i) is grounded)
 
### Part 2: Argument Mining

Mostly done. Need to test in ASPARTIX. 

 * Double check the supports(a16,a17). It could be an attack.
 * There should be a support from a4 to a0 ?

### Part 3: QuAD

Not started yet.

### Part 4: ABA

Not started yet.
